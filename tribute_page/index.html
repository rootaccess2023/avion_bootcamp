      <h2>Synopsis</h2>
      <p id="description">Jose Rizal, born on June 19, 1861, in Calamba, Laguna, Philippines, is widely regarded as the national hero of the Philippines. A polymath, Rizal was not only a revolutionary leader but also a physician, novelist, poet, essayist, and linguist.</p>

      <p id="description">Rizal's literary works, particularly his novels "Noli Me Tangere" (Touch Me Not) and "El Filibusterismo" (The Reign of Greed), played a pivotal role in inspiring Filipinos to seek independence from Spanish colonial rule. His writings exposed the injustices and abuses under Spanish occupation, challenging the status quo and promoting national identity.</p>

      <p id="description">Rizal's advocacy for social reforms, education, and his call for unity among Filipinos made him a symbol of resistance against oppression. His ideas and writings fueled the flame of the Philippine Revolution in the late 19th century.</p>

      <p id="description">In 1896, at the age of 35, Jose Rizal was executed by firing squad in Bagumbayan (now Luneta Park) in Manila, Philippines. His martyrdom further galvanized the Filipino people's resolve for independence, and Rizal's legacy continues to be celebrated in the Philippines as a symbol of heroism, nationalism, and the ongoing quest for freedom.</p>
