### Avion Bootcamp Project Portfolio

Welcome to my repository of web development projects completed during my time at Avion School. This collection represents the skills and knowledge I have honed in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Ruby on Rails throughout the intensive bootcamp curriculum.

#### Projects Overview:
- **HTML & CSS**: Projects utilizing the fundamentals of web development, including responsive web design and building forms.
- **JavaScript**: Interactive web applications featuring functions, objects, asynchronous programming, ES6, and DOM manipulation.
- **React**: Single-page applications leveraging React to create dynamic user interfaces.
- **Ruby on Rails**: Full-stack applications with a focus on back-end development using MVC architecture, ActiveRecord, and test-driven development.

Each project in this repository has been crafted with an emphasis on clean code, functionality, and user experience. They serve as real-world examples of my ability to develop web applications from concept to deployment.

#### What I've Learned:
- **Web Development Fundamentals**: Writing clean, maintainable, and responsive code.
- **Front-End Development**: Creating user-centric interfaces with a focus on performance and cross-browser compatibility.
- **Back-End Development**: Building robust server-side applications with a focus on scalability and security.
- **Version Control**: Proficient use of Git for version control and collaboration.

Through Avion School's rigorous program and hands-on approach, I've developed a strong foundation in web development, preparing me for a successful career in the tech industry.
